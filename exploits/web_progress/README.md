## Description
An **SQL injection vulnerability** in the **Dynamic Progress Bar module** allows remote authenticated attackers to **execute arbitrary SQL queries** through the External API, leading to privilege escalation.

## Affected product
**Dynamic Progress Bar**

## Technical name of affected product
web_progress

## Link to the Odoo Apps Store
https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/16.0/web_progress/

## Vulnerability type
SQL injection

## Impact
Privilege Escalation, Information Disclosure

## Affected components: 
`models/web_progress.py, WebProgress, get_all_progress(recency)`

## Attack vectors
A portal user or internal user of an Odoo instance with the `web_progress` module installed can trigger the '`get_all_progress` method using the External API, passing a crafted recency argument to the method to inject the SQL query of its choice that will be executed through the database cursor. 


## Proof-of-Concept

> [!NOTE] 
> A recorded demo of the PoC as well as the code for the exploit are available under this directoy

User `lucas` is a portal user and thus has no specific permission. User lucas sends an XML-RPC to the `web.progress` model through the External API , triggering the `get_all_progress` method. It passes a crafted `recency` argument that injects an SQL query modifying the admin password before executing the original intended query:


`models.execute_kw(db, uid, password, 'web.progress', 'get_all_progress', ["1 SECOND' GROUP BY code; UPDATE res_users SET password='whatever' WHERE login='admin'; SELECT code, array_agg(state) FROM web_progress WHERE create_date > timezone('utc', now()) - INTERVAL '1 "])`


Since the vulnerable method is a public method, it can be called from the External API. Also, since the database cursor is directly employed, no access rights checking is performed. No user input validation or sanitation is performed, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries, with consequences ranging from information disclosure to data tampering and privilege escalation. A possible patch could make use of prepared statements or make the affected method private to be no longer callable from the External API.
